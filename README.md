## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm super new to GitHub and all things code, but am keen to learn. My big interest is data science, and I'm working on a maths degree in my free time. I'm all about the numbers :-)

Just signed up to do the CodeFirstGirls Data Sceince degree, and I'm both terrified and excited in equal measure!
